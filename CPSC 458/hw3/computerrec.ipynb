    "#### Fundamental recommendation process/reasoning\n",
    " 1. The agent has preferences for features encoded as feature_stances in their goals field. A weighted sum of the pros and cons of the device as they pertain to the agent's goals is the first filter: if the pros vastly outweight the cons, then the device should be good for the agent and vice versa.  \n",
    " **Note:** a lack of a pro is a con, and a lack of a con is a pro.\n",
    " 2. People usually consider a single strong negative to outweight several moderate positives. I incorporate this reasoning by searching for a \"deal breaker\" next -- a single strong reason to not recommend the device.\n",
    " 3. At this point, there are no glaringly obvious, specific reasons to recommend or not recommend the device. Thus, I consider holistic evaluations next. The most relevant one would be past purchases, whether it's by the agent themselves or by someone they have a relation to. Whoever made that purchase would have an ex-post evaluation of the overall device, and if it's a strong evaluation in either direction, then that should strongly influence the decision to recommend or not. If there's mixed reviews, further detailed consideration is needed.\n",
    " 4. Finally, if there are at least two strong reasons to buy the computer feature-wise, the device is recommended. Otherwise, ignore C-level (unimportant) goals and redo calculations in step 1; recommend the device if and only if there is not a strong reason to not recommend the device (i.e. if and only if the cons don't vastly outweight the pros).\n",
    " #### On incorporating VOTE\n",
    "  - **Preferences:** The primary driving factor of the decision to recommend or not is precisely the preferences of the agent, encoded in their goals.\n",
    "  - **History of prior decisions:** Prior decisions and their results factor into the decision at step 3.\n",
    "  - **Relationships:** What makes a negative relationship in the context of a computer recommendation? A computer either worked well for the purposes of the individual who bought it or not. A decision of positive vs. negative relationships with someone else in terms of whether their goals align or not (i.e. whether or not their preferences for device features are the same or not) are already encoded within the individual's goals, too. Thus, the main purpose of relationships in the context of computer recommendations is whether or not the device as a bundle functions well together, i.e. it has a cohesive set of features. Therefore, I incorporated the relationships aspect of VOTE in the history of prior decisions aspect -- a past purchase of someone related factors into the decision similarly to a prior decision of the agent themselves."
